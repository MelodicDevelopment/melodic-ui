# MelodicUi

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.0.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project melodic-ui` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project melodic-ui`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project melodic-ui` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

1. Go to the `projects/melodic-ui/package.json` file and update the version number for the new release.
1. Run `npm run build:melodic-ui` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

> Note: If you're on windows you need to use a bash shell to run this
